                    <p>From 2016 to 2020, I developed software-based side-channel analysis tools for Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/software-guard-extensions.html">Software Guard Extensions (SGX)</a>, one of the first widely deployed commercial trusted execution environments (TEEs). Intel SGX introduced a new threat model where even privileged software (e.g., a compromised operating system or hypervisor) is considered untrusted. While designed to protect sensitive user data, this model also exposed SGX to powerful software-based side-channel attacks, most notably cache attacks.</p>
<p><img alt="drawing" src="assets/ring0sgx.png" title="Ring0 attacks SGX enclave." /></p>
<p>I developed <a href="https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/paper.php?pubkey=28943">CacheZoom</a>, one of the first privileged-adversary cache side-channel attacks on Intel SGX. CacheZoom exploited timer interrupts to amplify side-channel leakage, enabling highly precise attacks. Building on this work, we extended the analysis to cryptographic implementations deployed inside SGX for remote attestation. By combining CacheZoom with lattice-based cryptanalysis, we demonstrated the first break of SGX’s remote attestation mechanism, noted as <a href="https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/879">CacheQuote</a>.</p>
<p>Our work emphasized the importance of constant-time cryptography as the de facto mitigation strategy for TEEs. However, we also showed that constant-time programming is difficult to achieve in practice, and that an advanced privileged-adversary attacks <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/moghimi-copycat">CopyCat</a> can still undermine a wide range of cryptographic implementations.</p>
<p>This research influenced both academia and industry. It motivated Intel and cryptographic library maintainers to adopt standardized constant-time implementations and inspired the development of <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/constable">AEX-Notify</a>, an architectural defense against interrupt-driven side channels. Similar mitigations are now employed in Intel TDX confidential VMs, which inherit SGX’s threat model. </p>
