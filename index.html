<p>I am a <b>computer scientist & security researcher</b> who enjoys hacking on complex systems, developing tools for security analysis, and designing and evaluating new architectures to improve data security and privacy.

As a <a href="https://research.google/people/108392/?&type=google">research scientist at Google</a>, I lead several projects aimed at ensuring that high-performance computers and processors that run <b>AI</b> and other workloads strike the right <b>balance between security and performance</b>.

Toward this goal, I focus on various problem spaces such as memory safety, hardware and microarchitectural vulnerabilities, side channels, and reliable cryptographic implementations.  

You can read more about my past & current <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.

<p>
<b>Academia: </b>My last academic position was a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>. During that time, I received several tenure-track faculty offers from top 10 universities in the U.S. but ultimately chose to pursue an industry research career.

I continue to engage in academic activities, including serving on program committees, mentoring PhD students, authoring <a href="publications.html">research papers</a>, and giving talks at academic conferences. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Vulnerability Discovery: </b>I occasionally discover critical vulnerabilities, which some have led to presenting at Black Hat, one of the most prestigious computer security venues, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGKEwmMqwxE">2020</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLHh_oViXl8">2023</a>
